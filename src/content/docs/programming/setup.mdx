import { LinkCard, Steps, Icon, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The purpose of this guide is to help onboard new programmers by installing the necessary software on their local machine.
By the end, you’ll have everything needed to build and deploy robot code, run devcontainers, and collaborate with the team.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 laptop
- Internet access
- Admin privileges
- Basic command line knowledge
- ~20 minutes

---

## 1. Install IntelliJ IDEA

<Aside type="note" title="Why IntelliJ?">
  IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful IDE for JVM and cross-language development with first-class Gradle support,
  robust Git integration, and excellent debugging. Our team prefers IntelliJ for robot code development.
</Aside>

1. Download IntelliJ IDEA:
   - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
   - Choose **Community** (free) or **Ultimate** (if you have a license) → **Windows x64**.
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts. Accept defaults unless you have a personal preference.
3. After installation, open IntelliJ and install or enable these recommended plugins:
   - Docker (for interacting with containers)
   - Gradle (usually built-in)


4. Configure the JDK / Project SDK:
   - Install the team’s agreed JDK version (ask the team if unsure).
   - In IntelliJ: File → Project Structure → SDKs → Add the installed JDK.
   - When opening a Gradle-based robot project, IntelliJ will prompt to use an SDK — select the team JDK.

5. Clone and open the repo:
   - Use IntelliJ’s VCS menu: VCS → Get from Version Control → paste (replace OUR_REPO with the repo name):
     https://github.com/BC-Robotics-4504/OUR_REPO
   - Or clone on the command line and open the folder in IntelliJ:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BC-Robotics-4504/bcr-docs
   cd bcr-docs
   ```
   - Open the project in IntelliJ (File → Open)

<Aside type="tip">
  If you prefer the exact Dev Container workflow (automatic environment provisioning), VS Code's Dev Containers integration is more seamless.
  IntelliJ can still work with Docker/WSL via the Docker plugin and remote toolchains, but that requires extra configuration.
</Aside>

## 2. Install NI Game Tools

These tools are required to communicate with the roboRIO.

1. Download the latest **NI FRC Game Tools** from the official FIRST link:
   👉 [NI Game Tools Download](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html)
2. Run the installer and accept defaults.
3. Restart your computer after installation.

---

## 3. Install WPILib

WPILib is the core library and tooling for FRC robot programming.

1. Go to the official releases:
   👉 [WPILib GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases)
2. Download the latest **WPILib Installer for Windows**.
3. Run the installer. It will:
   - Install VS Code FRC extensions
   - Install the RoboRIO imaging tool
   - Set up Gradle for robot builds

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Always use the **team’s agreed WPILib version** during build season. Different versions can cause
  build errors.
</Aside>

## 4. Install OpenJDK 17

OpenJDK 17 (LTS) is the recommended Java runtime for our Gradle and robot builds.

1. Download Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK 17) from Adoptium:
  👉 https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17
  - Choose the Windows x64 MSI installer for an easy install.

2. Run the MSI installer and accept defaults.
  - If the installer offers to set JAVA_HOME, enable that option.

3. If JAVA_HOME wasn't set automatically, add it manually:
  - Settings → System → About → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables
  - Under System variables: New
    - Variable name: JAVA_HOME
    - Variable value: C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.x.x (adjust for the installed folder)
  - Edit the System PATH and add: %JAVA_HOME%\bin

4. Restart any open terminals (or your PC) so environment changes take effect.

5. Verify the installation:

PowerShell:
```sh
javac --version
```

---

## 5. Install Docker Desktop

Docker lets us run **Dev Containers** for a consistent environment across all machines.

1. Download from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Run the installer, accept defaults.
3. Enable **WSL 2 backend** when prompted.
4. Restart your computer.
5. Verify Docker is running from the system tray.

Check Docker works:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

## 6. Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

WSL provides a Linux environment on Windows. This is what Dev Containers use.

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
2. Run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

3. This installs **Ubuntu** by default. Restart when prompted.
4. After reboot, set a username/password for your Ubuntu environment.
5. Update Ubuntu packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

6. Verify:

```bash
wsl --list --verbose
```
