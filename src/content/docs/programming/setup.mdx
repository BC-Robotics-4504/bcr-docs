import { LinkCard, Steps, Icon, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The purpose of this guide is to help onboard new programmers by installing the necessary software on their local machine.
By the end, you’ll have everything needed to build and deploy robot code, run devcontainers, and collaborate with the team.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 11 laptop
- Internet access
- Admin privileges
- Basic command line knowledge
- ~20 minutes

---

## 1. Install VS Code

<Aside type="note" title="Why VS Code?">
  VS Code is beginner-friendly, supports **Dev Containers**, and has Git built in — making it the
  perfect editor for our team.
</Aside>

1. Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
2. Select the installer for **Windows x64**.
3. Run the installer from **File Explorer** and follow the prompts.
4. Once installed, open VS Code and sign in with a GitHub or Microsoft account (optional but recommended).

<Aside type="tip">
  Install the **Remote Development** and **Docker** extensions when prompted.
</Aside>

## 2. Install NI Game Tools

These tools are required to communicate with the roboRIO.

1. Download the latest **NI FRC Game Tools** from the official FIRST link:
   👉 [NI Game Tools Download](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html)
2. Run the installer and accept defaults.
3. Restart your computer after installation.

## 3. Install WPILib

WPILib is the core library and tooling for FRC robot programming.

1. Go to the official releases:
   👉 [WPILib GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases)
2. Download the latest **WPILib Installer for Windows**.
3. Run the installer. It will:
   - Install VS Code FRC extensions
   - Install the RoboRIO imaging tool
   - Set up Gradle for robot builds

<Aside type="caution" title="Important">
  Always use the **team’s agreed WPILib version** during build season. Different versions can cause
  build errors.
</Aside>

## 4. Install Python

Some of our tools and scripts rely on Python.

1. Download Python from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Choose the latest **Python 3.x (Windows installer)**.
3. Run the installer and check the box **“Add Python to PATH”**.
4. Verify installation:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

---

## 5. Install Docker Desktop

Docker lets us run **Dev Containers** for a consistent environment across all machines.

1. Download from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Run the installer, accept defaults.
3. Enable **WSL 2 backend** when prompted.
4. Restart your computer.
5. Verify Docker is running from the system tray.

Check Docker works:

```bash
docker --version
```

---

## 6. Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

WSL provides a Linux environment on Windows. This is what Dev Containers use.

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
2. Run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

3. This installs **Ubuntu** by default. Restart when prompted.
4. After reboot, set a username/password for your Ubuntu environment.
5. Update Ubuntu packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

6. Verify:

```bash
wsl --list --verbose
```

---

## 7. Test Dev Containers in VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Install the **Dev Containers** extension (if not already installed).
   - Open the VSCode Extension menu (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for Dev Containers
   - Click Install

3. Clone a test repo (like our docs site):

<Aside type="note">
  Ensure you followed the steps in the Git Setup guide to install Git on your system
</Aside>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BC-Robotics-4504/bcr-docs

cd bcr-docs
 ```

4. When VS Code prompts **“Reopen in Container”**, click it.
5. The container should build and open inside VS Code.

<Aside type="tip" title="✅ Success">
  If you reach this point, your machine is fully set up for FRC development. You can now contribute
  to robot code, docs, or CAD tooling using the same environment as everyone else.
