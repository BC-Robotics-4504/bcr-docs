This guide explains **what Git is**, how to use **GitHub**, and how to contribute to our team‚Äôs code and documentation.

---

## What is Git?

**Git** is a tool that tracks changes in files over time.
It lets multiple people work on the same code without overwriting each other.

Think of Git like Google Docs ‚Äúversion history‚Äù but for **robot code, CAD, and docs**.

---

## What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a website where we store our Git repositories (repos) online.
It makes it easy for our team to share code, track issues, and collaborate.

Our team‚Äôs main GitHub organization is:
üëâ [https://github.com/BC-Robotics-4504](https://github.com/BC-Robotics-4504) (BC Robotics)

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Git
- **Windows:** download [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Mac:** use Homebrew ‚Üí `brew install git`
- **Linux:** use your package manager (Ubuntu ‚Üí `sudo apt install git`)

Check it works:

```bash
git --version
```

---

### 2. Set Your Identity
Tell Git who you are (this shows up in commit history):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

### 3. Make a GitHub Account
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
- Create an account with your school or personal email
- Ask a mentor to add you to **Team 4504‚Äôs GitHub org**

---

### 4. Clone the Repo
Cloning means copying a repo from GitHub onto your computer.

Example for our robot code repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Team4504/robot-code.git
cd robot-code
```

---

### 5. Make a Branch
Branches are ‚Äúcopies‚Äù where you can safely make changes.

```bash
git checkout -b my-first-change
```

---

### 6. Make Changes
Open files in your editor (we recommend [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).
Change code, docs, or CAD files.

---

### 7. Save Your Changes (Commit)
Stage and commit your edits:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "my first commit: fixed drivetrain constants"
```

---

### 8. Push to GitHub
Send your changes up to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin my-first-change
```

---

### 9. Open a Pull Request (PR)
- Go to the repo on GitHub
- You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúCompare & Pull Request‚Äù
- Describe what you changed
- Ask for a review ‚Üí mentors or leads will merge it

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# check what files changed
git status

# see commit history
git log --oneline

# switch to another branch
git checkout main

# get the newest updates from GitHub
git pull origin main
```

## Video Tutorial

This video from Fireship does a good job of explaining the basic git concepts:
